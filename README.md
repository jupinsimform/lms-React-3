# To-do list application in React

## Part 2: Functional specifications

- When a user clicks on the + button, show a text input at the end of the list which can be editable, and hide the +button.
- Once text input is visible, If the user types and presses enter key, a new item should be added to the end of the list.
- Once text input is visible, If the user types nothing and presses enter key, give an error to enter something.
- Once text input is visible, If the user presses the Esc key, hide the text input and show back the + button again.
- The list should be scrollable but the date and time should be sticky at the top of the list.
- The list items created on a day should be available all the time, for the same day, and should not get removed on reloading. But if the user opens the list the next day, it should get reset with no items.
